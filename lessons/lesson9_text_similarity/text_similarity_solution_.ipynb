    "The similarity in vector space models is determined by using associative coefficients based on the inner product of the document vector and query vector, where word overlap indicates similarity.

If both of the term have high tfidf values, then they add a lot to the numerator. If a term does not exist in either documents, then it adds nothing to the numerator. On the other hand, the deonominator normalizes the documents, so that a document with many terms is punished with a larger denominator. "
